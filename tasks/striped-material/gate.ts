// Positive claim: the cube's surface carries a procedural pattern (bands, not one flat colour) and the
// pattern animates on its own with the camera untouched. Two discriminators: a single-frame brightness
// profile across the cube's face must oscillate (a flat face, even a corner-on cube showing two shaded
// faces, gives at most one light/dark step; stripes give several), and frames sampled over ~1s must
// differ (a static scene is bit-static, delta 0.00).

// brightness across a strip of cells along one axis over a wide central window, then trimmed to the
// contiguous cube run (cells brighter than the background). Trimming drops the cube's silhouette against
// the background — that outer edge would otherwise read as a band the surface never drew — while dark
// bands *inside* the cube stay, so a genuine stripe still registers.
//
// The scan axis is sampled at ~pixel resolution: cell count is derived from the scan window's pixel span,
// not a fixed n. A stripe is only visible to a human once each half-band spans ≥ ~2px post-antialiasing
// (below that, adjacent light/dark bands blur into one gray). So a cell of ≤ 2px resolves any stripe a
// human can see — with wider cells, one cell straddles a light and a dark band and averages them out (the
// n=40 false-negative: a 0.4-of-720p window is 7.2px/cell, wider than an 11px stripe's 5.5px half-band).
